Greetings! I’m Auguste Shikongo a Healthcare Data Analyst and Public Health Researcher originally from Namibia, now proudly based in Indianapolis, IN as a U.S. permanent resident.

With a completed Ph.D. and master’s in social work, and over 8 years of experience in healthcare analytics, public health research, and program evaluation across both international and U.S. settings, I specialize in transforming complex health data into actionable insights. I also hold a Data Analytics certificate from Career Foundry.

My work spans behavioral health, primary care, and population health systems using tools like Python, SQL, Tableau, and SPSS to improve patient outcomes, inform policy, and support evidence-based decisions. I’ve led projects building predictive models, clinician dashboards, and national-level health tracking systems.
Whether it's enhancing behavioral health interventions or shaping strategic health planning, I bring a unique blend of domain expertise, analytical rigor, and cross-cultural experience. I'm passionate about data-driven solutions that make healthcare smarter, more equitable, and more impactful.
Let’s connect  I’m open to new opportunities, collaborations, and conversations that drive change through data.
