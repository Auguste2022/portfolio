# About me
Greetings! I’m Auguste Shikongo, originally from Namibia and now a proud permanent resident of the USA, based in Indianapolis, IN. With a background in social work at the maters’s and Ph.D levels, I discovered a passion for working with numbers, leading me to pursue further education in data analysis with Career Foundry

Transitioning from social work to data analysis, I bring a blend of empathy, problem-soling, and communication skills. Through my Career Foundry course, I honed analytical abilities and gained proficiency in tools like Excel, SQL, Python, and data visualization.

Now, I m, excited to apply my experience to the field of data analysis. Beyond crunching numbers, I excel at spotting patterns and uncovering insights that drive informed decision-making. My goal is to secure a full-time role where I can leverage my skills to interpret complex datasets and contribute to organizational success.
